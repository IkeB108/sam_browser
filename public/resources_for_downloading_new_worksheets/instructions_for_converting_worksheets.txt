In the WSL terminal:
pdftoppm file1.pdf outputfilename -jpg -r 50

(-r 50 = 50 dpm. Default is 150)

To do all:
for file in *.pdf; do pdftoppm "$file" "../jpeg/${file%.pdf}_" -jpeg -r 300; done

-r 300 means set DPI to 300 (default is 150). This is to minimize JPEG compression artifacts so that I can then compress images to WEBP format with these settings in Irfanview:

Output format: WEBP
Options:
  Quality: 20
  Compression method: 6 (slowest)
Advanced:
  Resize: Set new size as percentage of original: 20%
  Preserve aspect ratio
  Use Resample function
